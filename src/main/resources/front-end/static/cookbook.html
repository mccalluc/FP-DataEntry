			<dt>Filling in the fields automatically is great, but the iframe is a distraction.</dt>
			<dd>
				It isn't actually necessary to add any noticeable UI elements: 
				The iframe needs to be present, but you can specify the width and height as just 1x1,
				or use css to hide it entirely.
			</dd>
			
			<dt>Can the style of the iframe match the style of the rest of my application?</dt>
			<dd>
				You can specify css files to be loaded in the iframe with the css_urls parameter.
			</dd>
			
			<dt>Can the workflow be more fluid?</dt>
			<dd>
				In the demo, a button click brings up the iframe, but it could be lighter-weight:
				For example, it could be triggered by onchange, or even by onload, so that
				it's there and available without any special action from the user.
			</dd>
			
			<dt>What if I can't change the html in the host data entry application?</dt>
			<dd>
				The plugin can also be started with a bookmarklet (ie, a "javascript:" URI). 
				Instead of clicking a button on the page, you'll need to click a bookmark,
				but apart from that, the functionality is the same.
			</dd>
			
			<dt>Could information from two different sources be combined?</dt>
			<dd>
				I can think of two ways to do this: One would be to create an index which combines both sources.
				A different approach would be to just have two independent iframes.
			</dd>
			
			<dt>Could this tool be used to directly query a database, instead of indexing everything before hand?</dt>
			<dd>
				Maybe: <code>GenericRecordsForIndexAndUpdate</code> could be extended to get data from a database
				instead of from solr. I haven't tried.
			</dd>
			
			<dt>Could this tool be used on top of another web-service, instead of indexing everything before hand?</dt>
			<dd>
				Maybe: <code>GenericRecordsForIndexAndUpdate</code> could also be extended so that instead of querying the
				embedded solr, it hits some API on the web, parses the results, and proxies them back. Or, conceivably,
				if the back-end API is JSONP or it supports CORS, the change handler in <code>core.js</code> could be changed
				to hit that API instead of the back end server. I haven't done either of these, so it would be an experiment.
